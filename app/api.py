"""
The front door.

The agent is a Python library. You can call it from a script, but you cannot
visit it in a browser. This file is the missing piece: it puts an HTTP address
in front of the one function that matters.

    agent.turn(user_id, thread_id, message)  ->  reply

Three addresses:

    GET  /         the chat page
    POST /chat     send a message, get a reply
    GET  /health   is everything wired up?

That is the entire deployment. The agent itself is untouched.
